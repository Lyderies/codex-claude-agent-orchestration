## 0.2.0: cross-provider read-only routing (G2)

- **Provider-qualified routes.**
  - Policy v5 lists Codex and Claude models and roles.
  - Each family and route key has an ordered list of provider candidates, matching
    `docs/routing-table.md`, and a table-driven test fails CI on drift.
  - Selection is the first candidate that passes the static eligibility checks; there is no
    silent fallback.
  - Routes carry the provider, the dispatch path and the provider configuration digest, and
    replay exactly.
- **Project provider configuration.** `.codex/orchestration/provider-routing.json` enables
  providers and models, and controls whether a Codex primary may bridge to Claude. It must be
  committed and clean.
- **Admission gate.** Fails closed, and its decision is bound to the run. It denies:
  - API-key and alternate-backend environments;
  - an unreviewed client version;
  - an identity older than 30 minutes or a non-subscription plan;
  - a missing owner billing attestation;
  - stale, unknown or paid-usage billing evidence;
  - exhausted headroom (90% of a window, or a rejection);
  - a per-account run-count cap.

  Billing, headroom and bootstrap evidence apply account-wide, across projects.
- **Dispatch bridge.** Starts the other provider's client for a read-only child.
  - The workspace holds only the committed bytes of granted paths.
  - The Claude profile is locked.
  - The Codex profile is locked: account connectors, web search, image generation and goals are
    off, and an event allowlist detects anything else.
  - Every run has a durable intent, a hard deadline and no resend.
  - Billing is re-checked at launch, and a run stops on in-run overage or rejection.
  - Bridged runs bind and commit only their own dispatch.
- **Claude primary.** A `claude-host-v1` host client and a Claude orchestration skill, installed
  with the Codex package.
  - Host detection and per-orchestration host ownership.
  - Native Claude spawn parameters are computed by the CLI.
  - A gated billing probe supplies the evidence native Claude children cannot.
- **Observations.** Headroom, billing and usage records are bound to their run and phase. A failed
  reading is recorded instead of dropped.
- **Package version.** The Codex package is now 0.8.0. It had kept the imported 0.7.2, so an existing
  collector authorized for 0.7.2 refused the changed build as a conflict instead of upgrading.

Security: two whole-release reviews by two vendors, over two rounds, found 14 defects; all were
fixed. A separate review of the Codex lockdown narrowed the reviewed Codex client range to the
build where containment was shown live.

## 0.1.0: import and one-command install (G1)

- **Packages imported.** The Codex and Claude agent packages are now developed here, in `packages/`.
  `PROVENANCE.json` records each file's source commit and hash, and lists the files changed after
  import, with reasons.
- **One-command installer.** `scripts/install.py` installs, verifies or removes both packages in a
  Git project.
  - Preview is the default, and nothing is applied unless both packages preview cleanly.
  - It refuses targets that are mid-merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, bisect or sequence, that
    have unmerged paths, or that are not the top of their working tree.
  - When applying, it also refuses uncommitted changes in managed paths.
  - It adopts an existing install without changing it, and rolls back if a later package fails.
- **Linked worktrees.** Both installers accept a linked worktree's `.git` marker. The Claude
  packager checks the marker without following it.
- **Public-repository guard.** An identifier scanner runs on every commit and in CI. It reports
  only the category and location of a finding, never the value.
- **CI.** Linux and macOS run the repository tests and both package suites. Failures are reported
  as annotations. The Codex package's operational-check sandbox is macOS-only, so those tests are
  skipped elsewhere.
- **Routing table.** `docs/routing-table.md` is the living, evidence-driven table the orchestrator
  routes by, with a changelog.

Verified by rehearsal on a clone of the pilot project:

- installing over its existing packages changed nothing;
- removing and reinstalling restored the identical Git tree;
- both packages verified ready.
